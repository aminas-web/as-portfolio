                <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <p class="par">I am an instructional designer with a strong foundation in education and a proven track record of creating engaging, results-focused learning materials for diverse audiences. Over more than a decade, I have designed lessons, guides, assessments, and multimedia resources that make complex concepts clear and practical. My work has taken me not only to classrooms in the U.S., but also to international learning environments, which helped me develop the adaptability, cultural awareness, and creative problem-solving skills that now shape my instructional design approach.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container-inner">
                <h2>My approach</h2>
                <p class="par">I believe learning should be relevant, accessible, and memorable. In every project, I start by understanding the learners’ needs, goals, and challenges. I collaborate closely with stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure content is accurate, targeted, and aligned with organizational objectives.</p>
                <p class="par">I apply instructional design frameworks such as ADDIE and SAM to guide my process—using structured analysis and design when needed, and rapid prototyping for projects that require agility and iteration. My experience includes developing clear instructional guides, interactive activities, video tutorials, and assessments that measure and reinforce learning outcomes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="container-inner">
                <h2>How I work with teams</h2>
                <p class="par">Collaboration is at the heart of my process. I have partnered with colleagues across disciplines, cultures, and time zones to deliver learning solutions that resonate with diverse learners. I actively seek feedback, value different perspectives, and believe the best results come from combining individual strengths toward a shared goal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container-inner">
                <h2>What I deliver</h2>
                <p class="par">I design learning experiences that are visually engaging and strategically crafted. I focus on making training both effective and enjoyable, helping learners not just understand new information, but apply it confidently in real situations.</p>
