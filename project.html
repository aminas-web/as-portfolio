                <p class="par"><b>Hallway Hero: CPR on ages 12 and above</b></p>
                <img class="homepage-images" src="featured project.jpg" alt="A laptop with a CPR training on the screen" width="800px">

                <p class="par">This gamified eLearning experience teaches teachers the correct steps to take when assessing if a person needs CPR and how to perform it effectively. Through scenario-based gameplay, learners navigate realistic emergencies, make key decisions, and receive immediate feedback on their choices. The interactive design reinforces each stage of the CPR process, ensuring learners know exactly what to do in real-life situations. At the end of the game, players can download a step-by-step CPR guide and have this course readily available for refreshing their memory.</p>

                <p class="par"><span class="par-bold">Audience:</span> K–12 teachers learning or refreshing their memory on how to assess and perform CPR on individuals aged 12 and older</p>

                <h2> <span class="underlined">Problem and Solution:</span></h2>

                <p class="par">Many teachers are required to know CPR, but over time, the exact steps can be forgotten, especially in high-stress situations. While most have taken a CPR course before, the challenge is retaining the confidence to act quickly and correctly when faced with a real emergency. For others who have never had formal training, there is still a strong need to understand the basics of CPR so they can step in if needed. Without regular practice or refreshers, hesitation or mistakes could delay critical care.</p>
                <p class="par">For this practice project, I designed a gamified, scenario-based eLearning experience to address these gaps. The training allows teachers to practice identifying when CPR is needed and performing it correctly, all within a safe, interactive environment. Immediate feedback after each decision reinforces learning and corrects mistakes in real time. To support long-term retention, the module ends with a downloadable step-by-step CPR guide and a knowledge check so learners can test their readiness.</p>

                <h2> <span class="underlined">My Process</span></h2>

                <p class="par">For this practice project, I followed the ADDIE model to guide my design and development. I began with the Analysis phase by researching CPR guidelines from trusted organizations such as the American Heart Association to ensure accuracy. I also reviewed existing training materials and watched CPR demonstration videos to understand both the correct steps and common learner mistakes.</p>
                <p class="par">To gain a deeper perspective, I consulted publicly available instructional resources and observed how scenario-based eLearning has been applied in other life-saving skills training. I identified that the biggest learning gap for teachers was confidence in recognizing when CPR is necessary and performing it correctly.</p>

        <div class="container-inner">
                <h2> <span class="underlined">Action Map</span></h2>
                <img class="homepage-images" src="CPR Action Map.jpg" alt="A document with an action map of the eLearning experience. Key problems, main goal, and key actions" width="800px">

                <p class="par">Using the insights from my research, I created an action map to define the project’s primary goal: enabling teachers to make quick, correct decisions when assessing a person’s condition and delivering CPR. I then broke this into specific, observable actions—such as checking responsiveness, calling for help, and performing compressions—prioritizing the most critical steps to keep the training clear, concise, and actionable.</p>

        <div class="container-inner">
                <h2> <span class="underlined">Text-Based Storyboard</span></h2>
                <img class="homepage-images" src="CPR text scenario 1.png" alt="A screenshot of a document with the text-based scenario" width="800px">
                <img class="homepage-images" src="CPR text scenario 2.png" alt="A screenshot of a document with the text-based scenario" width="800px">

                <p class="par">After completing the action map, I moved into the design phase by creating a text-based storyboard, which served as the blueprint for the entire module. My goal was to immerse learners in a realistic emergency scenario where they would assess a person’s condition, decide whether CPR was needed, and follow the correct steps to perform it.</p>
                <p class="par">Each decision point offered one correct choice and three plausible but incorrect options, with immediate feedback to reinforce the correct process or explain why an action was ineffective. To provide in-course support, I introduced a mentor character—a nurse trained in CPR—who guides learners through each stage of the scenario, offering prompts, encouragement, and helpful reminders. This character not only aids comprehension but also mirrors the reassurance learners might receive in a real-life emergency when working alongside a trained colleague.</p>

                <p class="par">To bring the storyboard to life, I began by creating a mood board to define the visual tone of the module—professional, approachable, and easy to follow in a high-stakes learning context. From there, I developed a style guide to maintain consistency across all slides, ensuring a clean layout, clear typography, and accessible color contrasts.</p>

                <p class="par">I built an interactive prototype in Articulate Storyline 360 to test the functionality, flow, and learner experience before developing the full module. My priority was to make the environment feel realistic and immersive while maintaining clarity for learners under potentially stressful subject matter.</p>
                <p class="par">The prototype included the introduction, a sequence of branching decision points, immediate feedback for each choice, and the mentor button feature that allowed learners to get guidance without disrupting the scenario. I designed visuals and layouts directly in Storyline to ensure accessibility and ease of navigation.</p>
